# numble-solver

Gorilla mode numble solver. Instead of using permutations and bruteforcing we use random numbers. Could be optimized to ensure re-using random permutations that don't end in a solution are not repeated.
Only finds solutions that use all numbers and that are of the form (((((x # x) # x) # x) # x) # x) 
No multiple bracket operations supported currently
